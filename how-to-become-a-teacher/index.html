      <h1>Steps to become a teacher</h1>

      <p>To become a primary or secondary school teacher in England you will need to have a degree.</p>

<p>You will then need to take a teaching qualification called initial teacher training (ITT). ITT gives you qualified teacher status (QTS). You’ll need QTS to teach in a state school in England.</p>

<p><a href="./if-you-need-to-get-the-right-qualifications#if-you-have-an-overseas-degree" class="internal">If you have an overseas degree <span class="arrow">&gt;</span></a></p>

<p>If you want to teach in a fee-paying or private school, the rules may be different. You’ll need to check with the type of school you want to teach at.</p>

      <h4 id="if-you-have-a-degree">If you have a degree</h4>

      <p>If you want to teach in a primary or secondary school you can apply for postgraduate initial teacher training (ITT) to give you qualified teacher status (QTS). You’ll need:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>grade 4 (C) or above in English and maths GCSE</li>
        <li>grade 4 (C) or above in GCSE science if you want to teach primary</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you do not have GCSEs in English, maths and science, you’ll need to show that you have an equivalent level of education.</p>

      <p>You’ll find it useful to get some classroom experience, although it’s not compulsory. You’ll see teaching in action and get a taste of school life. Spending time in a school will also help you understand some of the skills and qualities teachers have. Teachers need the ability to:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>relate to pupils and their parents</li>
        <li>be creative to inspire and motivate pupils</li>
        <li>deal with conflict and remain calm in stressful situations</li>
        <li>constantly learn and improve</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Your experience can help you decide whether teaching is right for you.</p>

      <p>Use the <a href="https://schoolexperience.education.gov.uk">Get school experience</a> service.</p>

      <p>Do a <a href="#">teaching internship</a> if you’re a STEM-related degree student.</p>

      <div class="explanation">
        <p><strong>STEM-related degree</strong></p>

        <p>STEM stands for science, technology, engineering and mathematics and refers to any subjects that come under these four areas.</p>

      <p>For primary and secondary school teaching you’ll do postgraduate Initial Teacher Training (ITT) to give you QTS. You could do your training:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>at university</li>
        <li>in a school</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Both types of training will give you lots of classroom experience and the knowledge to teach successfully. The type of course you choose will depend on whether you want to study at a university or be based in a school.</p>

      <h4 id="train-at-university">Train at university</h4>

      <p>You’ll do a postgraduate certificate in education (PGCE) to give you QTS. Most courses are full time for one year. You may be able to study part time if the university you choose has this option. During your course you will:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>study on campus</li>
        <li>spend 24 weeks on school placements at 2 schools</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Training at university may be the right choice for you if it’s important to you that you will:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>spend time with other trainee teachers</li>
        <li>be able to move from a school placement if it doesn’t suit you</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 id="train-in-a-school">Train in a school</h4>

      <p>Training to teach in a school will usually take 1 year. You’ll spend your time:</p>

      <p>learning from experienced teachers by working in the school team
studying the theory of teaching at college or university</p>

      <p>Training to teach in a school is often called school-led training.</p>

      <p>School-led training may be the right choice for you if you want to:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>learn how to become a teacher while you work at a school</li>
        <li>get a job in the network of schools where you’ve trained</li>
      </ul>
