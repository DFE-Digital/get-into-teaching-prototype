      <h2 id="initial-teacher-training-itt">Initial teacher training (ITT)</h2>

<p>To become a primary or secondary school teacher in England you’ll need to do a teaching qualification called initial teacher training (ITT). ITT gives you qualified teacher status (QTS).</p>

<p>You’ll need QTS to teach in a state school in England. If you want to teach in a fee-paying or private school, the rules may be different. You’ll need to check with the type of school you want to teach at.</p>

<h3 id="if-you-do-not-have-a-degree">If you do not have a degree</h3>

<p>You’ll need to apply for an initial teacher training (ITT) course that will give you qualified teacher status (QTS). Courses usually take 3 to 4 years and include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bachelor of Education degree (BEd)</li>
  <li>Bachelor of Arts (BA) and Bachelor of Science (BSc) with QTS</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="#">Search UCAS to find a degree with QTS</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#">Get advice on how to get started from the Get into teaching service</a>.</p>

<h4 id="if-you-have-a-levels-in-maths-or-physics">If you have A levels in maths or physics</h4>

<p>If you want to teach maths or physics you could apply to Future Teaching Scholars. You’ll need A levels at grade B or above in maths or physics. You’ll choose to study a maths or physics degree, followed by specialist teacher training. You’ll get a grant of up to £15,000 to support you during your degree.</p>

<h3 id="check-your-qualifications">1. Check your qualifications</h3>

<h4 id="if-you-have-a-degree">If you have a degree</h4>

<p>If you want to teach in a primary or secondary school you can apply for postgraduate initial teacher training (ITT) to give you qualified teacher status (QTS). You’ll need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>grade 4 (C) or above in English and maths GCSE</li>
  <li>grade 4 (C) or above in GCSE science if you want to teach primary</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do not have GCSEs in English, maths and science, you’ll need to show that you have an equivalent level of education.</p>

<h4 id="if-your-degree-is-not-in-the-subject-you-want-to-teach">If your degree is not in the subject you want to teach</h4>

<p>If you need to top up your knowledge of the subject you want to teach, you could take a subject knowledge enhancement course (SKE). An SKE may be right for you if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your degree is not in the subject you want to teach, but is related</li>
  <li>you studied the subject at A level, but not at degree level</li>
  <li>you have an unrelated degree, but relevant professional experience in the subject</li>
  <li>it’s been some time since you used your degree knowledge</li>
</ul>

<p>You can do an SKE course in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>maths</li>
  <li>physics</li>
  <li>languages</li>
  <li>chemistry</li>
  <li>computer studies</li>
  <li>biology</li>
  <li>English</li>
  <li>geography</li>
  <li>design and technology</li>
  <li>religious education</li>
  <li>primary maths</li>
</ul>

<p>Courses last between 8 and 28 weeks. SKE courses are funded, so you will not have to pay any tuition fees. You may also be eligible for a bursary of £5,600 for a 28-week course or £2,400 for a shorter course of 12 weeks.</p>

<h4 id="if-you-have-an-overseas-degree">If you have an overseas degree</h4>

<p>If you studied overseas, you’ll need to find out if your qualifications are recognised in the UK. Contact us on 0800 389 2500 for advice. We can also give you a free UK National Recognition Information Centre (UK NARIC) statement to show what your qualifications are equivalent to in the UK.</p>

<p>If you’re a graduate from outside the European Economic Area (EEA), you may need to apply for a visa before starting your teacher training course. Contact the school or university you want to train with to find out.</p>

<h3 id="get-experience-in-a-school">2. Get experience in a school</h3>

<p>You’ll find it useful to get some classroom experience. You’ll see teaching in action and get a taste of school life. Spending time in a school will also help you understand some of the skills and qualities teachers have. Teachers need the ability to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>relate to pupils and their parents</li>
  <li>be creative to inspire and motivate pupils</li>
  <li>deal with conflict and remain calm in stressful situations</li>
  <li>constantly learn and improve</li>
</ul>

<p>Your experience can help you decide whether teaching is right for you.</p>

<p><a href="https://schoolexperience.education.gov.uk">Use the Get school experience service</a>.</p>

<h3 id="decide-how-to-train">3. Decide how to train</h3>

<p>For primary and secondary school teaching you’ll do postgraduate Initial Teacher Training (ITT) to give you QTS. You could do your training:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="./train-at-university">at university</a></li>
  <li><a href="./train-in-a-school">in a school</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Both types of training will give you lots of classroom experience and the knowledge to teach successfully. The type of course you choose will depend on whether you want to study at a university or be based in a school.</p>

<h3 id="apply-for-training">4. Apply for training</h3>

<h3 id="training-to-teach-children-with-special-educational-needs-andor-disabilities-send">Training to teach children with special educational needs and/or disabilities (SEND)</h3>

<p>All teaching courses with QTS include training on working with pupils who have special educational needs and/or disabilities (SEND).
You could also choose a teacher training course with a SEND specialism. Your course would develop your skills for working with pupils with SEND. Find courses with an emphasis on SEND by selecting ‘Show only courses with a SEND specialism’. If you teach SEND pupils you could be eligible for an extra yearly payment to your salary of between £2,149 and £4,242.</p>
