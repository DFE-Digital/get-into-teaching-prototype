      <h1>Train in a school</h1>

      <!-- a href="../../">< back</a -->

      <p>Training to teach in a school will usually take 1 year. You’ll spend your time:</p>

<ul>
  <li>learning from experienced teachers by working in the school team</li>
  <li>studying the theory of teaching at college or university</li>
</ul>

<p>Training to teach in a school is often called school-led training.</p>

<p>School-led training may be the right choice for you if you want to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>learn how to become a teacher while you work at a school</li>
  <li>get a job in the network of schools where you’ve trained</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="school-direct">School Direct</h2>
<p>School Direct is a school-led way of doing your initial teacher training (ITT). Each school recruits their own trainees. Your training will take 1 year. Once you’ve done your training you’ll be employed by that school (or partnership of schools).</p>

<h3 id="school-direct-tuition-fee-places">School Direct tuition fee places</h3>
<p>You’ll pay for your tuition fees. (You may be able to get a bursary or scholarship)[../life-as-a-teacher/teachers-salaries-and-benefits].</p>

<h3 id="school-direct-salaried-places">School Direct salaried places</h3>
<p>You’ll earn a salary while you train and you will not pay tuition fees. These places are usually given to graduates with at least 3 years’ work experience.</p>

<h2 id="postgraduate-teaching-apprenticeship">Postgraduate teaching apprenticeship</h2>
<p>Postgraduate teaching apprenticeships are similar to school direct salaried places. You’ll be employed by a school to learn on the job over 4 terms. You’ll then take an assessment. This is a salaried training place so you will not pay tuition fees.</p>

<h2 id="teach-first">Teach First</h2>
<p>You’ll need to have a 2:1 degree or higher to apply for a place. You’ll train over 2 years by learning on the job. You’ll be paid as an unqualified teacher and you will not pay tuition fees.</p>

<h2 id="researchers-in-schools">Researchers in schools</h2>
<p>You’ll need (or be about to finish) a doctorate in the subject you want to teach. You’ll then train over 3 years with a bursary. If you have a lot of relevant work experience you could train and earn a salary.</p>

<h2 id="assessment-only-ao">Assessment only (AO)</h2>
<p>If you’re a teaching assistant or unqualified teacher with two years’ experience you can be assessed over 12 weeks to get QTS. This way of getting QTS will not give you a PGCE. You’ll only need a PGCE if you want to do a master’s qualification or teach outside the UK.</p>
