<section>
  <h2 id="if-you-dont-have-a-degree">If you don’t have a degree</h2>

  <p>You’ll need to apply for an initial teacher training (ITT) course that will give you qualified teacher status (QTS). Courses usually take 3 to 4 years and include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Bachelor of Education degree (BEd)</li>
    <li>Bachelor of Arts (BA) and Bachelor of Science (BSc) with QTS</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Search <a href="#">UCAS</a> to find a degree with QTS.</p>

  <p><a href="/">Go back to the home page</a></p>

  <p>Sign up to get support from a teacher training adviser, who can help you with your personal statement, which funding you can get and how to complete your application.</p>

  <h2 id="if-you-have-an-overseas-degree">If you have an overseas degree</h2>

  <p>If you studied overseas, you’ll need to find out if your qualifications are recognised in the UK. Contact us on 0800 389 2500 for advice.</p>

  <p>We can also give you a free UK National Recognition Information Centre (UK NARIC) statement to show what your qualifications are equivalent to in the UK.</p>

  <p>If you’re a graduate from outside the European Economic Area (EEA), you may need to apply for a visa before starting your teacher training course.</p>

  <p>Contact the school or university you want to train with to find out.</p>

  <h3 id="school-direct-salaried-places">School Direct salaried places</h3>

  <p>You’ll earn a salary while you train and you will not pay tuition fees. These places are usually given to graduates with at least 3 years’ work experience.</p>

  <h3 id="postgraduate-teaching-apprenticeship">Postgraduate teaching apprenticeship</h3>

  <p>Postgraduate teaching apprenticeships are similar to school direct salaried places. You’ll be employed by a school to learn on the job over 4 terms. You’ll then take an assessment. This is a salaried training place so you will not pay tuition fees.</p>

  <h3 id="teach-first">Teach First</h3>

  <p>You’ll need to have a 2:1 degree or higher to apply for a place. You’ll train over 2 years by learning on the job. You’ll be paid as an unqualified teacher and you will not pay tuition fees.</p>

  <h3 id="researchers-in-schools">Researchers in schools</h3>

  <p>You’ll need (or be about to finish) a doctorate in the subject you want to teach. You’ll then train over 3 years with a bursary. If you have a lot of relevant work experience you could train and earn a salary.</p>

  <h3 id="assessment-only-ao">Assessment only (AO)</h3>

  <p>If you’re a teaching assistant or unqualified teacher with two years’ experience you can be assessed over 12 weeks to get QTS. This way of getting QTS will not give you a PGCE. You’ll only need a PGCE if you want to do a master’s qualification or teach outside the UK.</p>
