If you want to teach maths or physics you could apply to Future Teaching Scholars. You’ll need A levels at grade B or above in maths or physics. You’ll choose to study a maths or physics degree, followed by specialist teacher training. You’ll get a grant of up to £15,000 to support you during your degree.
