You’ll do a postgraduate certificate in education (PGCE) to give you QTS. Most courses are full time for one year. You may be able to study part time if the university you choose has this option. During your course you will:

  - study on campus
  - spend 24 weeks on school placements at 2 schools

Training at university may be the right choice for you if it’s important to you that you will:

  - spend time with other trainee teachers
  - be able to move from a school placement if it doesn’t suit you
