To become a primary or secondary school teacher in England you’ll need to do a teaching qualification called initial teacher training (ITT). ITT gives you qualified teacher status (QTS).

You’ll need QTS to teach in a state school in England. If you want to teach in a fee-paying or private school, the rules may be different. You’ll need to check with the type of school you want to teach at.

##If you do not have a degree

You’ll need to apply for an initial teacher training (ITT) course that will give you qualified teacher status (QTS). Courses usually take 3 to 4 years and include:

###1. Check your qualifications

####If you have a degree

If you want to teach in a primary or secondary school you can apply for postgraduate initial teacher training (ITT) to give you qualified teacher status (QTS). You’ll need:

  - grade 4 (C) or above in English and maths GCSE
  - grade 4 (C) or above in GCSE science if you want to teach primary

If you do not have GCSEs in English, maths and science, you’ll need to show that you have an equivalent level of education.

####If your degree is not in the subject you want to teach

If you need to top up your knowledge of the subject you want to teach, you could take a subject knowledge enhancement course (SKE). An SKE may be right for you if:

  - your degree is not in the subject you want to teach, but is related
  - you studied the subject at A level, but not at degree level
  - you have an unrelated degree, but relevant professional experience in the subject
  - it's been some time since you used your degree knowledge

You can do an SKE course in:

  - maths
  - physics
  - languages
  - chemistry
  - computer studies
  - biology
  - English
  - geography
  - design and technology
  - religious education
  - primary maths

Courses last between 8 and 28 weeks. SKE courses are funded, so you will not have to pay any tuition fees. You may also be eligible for a bursary of £5,600 for a 28-week course or £2,400 for a shorter course of 12 weeks.

####If you have an overseas degree

If you studied overseas, you’ll need to find out if your qualifications are recognised in the UK. Contact us on 0800 389 2500 for advice. We can also give you a free UK National Recognition Information Centre (UK NARIC) statement to show what your qualifications are equivalent to in the UK.

If you’re a graduate from outside the European Economic Area (EEA), you may need to apply for a visa before starting your teacher training course. Contact the school or university you want to train with to find out.

###2. Get experience in a school

You’ll find it useful to get some classroom experience. You’ll see teaching in action and get a taste of school life. Spending time in a school will also help you understand some of the skills and qualities teachers have. Teachers need the ability to:

  - relate to pupils and their parents
  - be creative to inspire and motivate pupils
  - deal with conflict and remain calm in stressful situations
  - constantly learn and improve

Your experience can help you decide whether teaching is right for you.

###3. Decide how to train

For primary and secondary school teaching you’ll do postgraduate Initial Teacher Training (ITT) to give you QTS. You could do your training:

  - [at university](./train-at-university)
  - [in a school](./train-in-a-school)

Both types of training will give you lots of classroom experience and the knowledge to teach successfully. The type of course you choose will depend on whether you want to study at a university or be based in a school.
