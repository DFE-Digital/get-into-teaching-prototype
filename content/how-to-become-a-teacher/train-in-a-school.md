Training to teach in a school will usually take 1 year. You’ll spend your time:

  - learning from experienced teachers by working in the school team
  - studying the theory of teaching at college or university

Training to teach in a school is often called school-led training.

School-led training may be the right choice for you if you want to:

  - learn how to become a teacher while you work at a school
  - get a job in the network of schools where you’ve trained

##School Direct
School Direct is a school-led way of doing your initial teacher training (ITT). Each school recruits their own trainees. Your training will take 1 year. Once you’ve done your training you’ll be employed by that school (or partnership of schools).

###School Direct tuition fee places
You’ll pay for your tuition fees. (You may be able to get a bursary or scholarship)[../life-as-a-teacher/teachers-salaries-and-benefits].

###School Direct salaried places
You’ll earn a salary while you train and you will not pay tuition fees. These places are usually given to graduates with at least 3 years’ work experience.

##Postgraduate teaching apprenticeship
Postgraduate teaching apprenticeships are similar to school direct salaried places. You’ll be employed by a school to learn on the job over 4 terms. You’ll then take an assessment. This is a salaried training place so you will not pay tuition fees.

##Teach First
You’ll need to have a 2:1 degree or higher to apply for a place. You’ll train over 2 years by learning on the job. You’ll be paid as an unqualified teacher and you will not pay tuition fees.

##Researchers in schools
You’ll need (or be about to finish) a doctorate in the subject you want to teach. You’ll then train over 3 years with a bursary. If you have a lot of relevant work experience you could train and earn a salary.

##Assessment only (AO)
If you’re a teaching assistant or unqualified teacher with two years’ experience you can be assessed over 12 weeks to get QTS. This way of getting QTS will not give you a PGCE. You’ll only need a PGCE if you want to do a master’s qualification or teach outside the UK.
