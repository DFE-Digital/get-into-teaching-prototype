  Teaching will give you the chance to use your skills to inspire young people and make sure every pupil gets the same access to a quality education.  It’s a career that offers varied opportunities, where no day is ever the same.

##Inspire the next generation
As a teacher you can help children develop their talents and expand your own skills too.

In addition to the day job you can get involved in after-school activities, clubs, trips or sport.

##Career progression
Training to be a teacher will give you the opportunities to add to your professional skills and help you achieve your ambitions.

The Department for Education (DfE) has made it easier to find a teaching role in England, by using the [Teaching Vacancies service](https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/ "external-inline").

###Leadership
Leadership roles in a school can offer a number of different opportunities, from taking charge of a year group or a particular key stage; to becoming a deputy or headteacher.

As a leader, you’ll have an influence in the school, setting high standards and ensuring continuous improvement throughout the school.

###Focus on your subject
If you’re passionate about your subject area, you can pursue a career as a head of department or as a leading practitioner.  

In these roles you’ll still teach, but have additional responsibilities.

###Pastoral care
If you’re interested in the welfare of students throughout their education, a pastoral role might be for you. You could also take on the role of a mentor for young people with special educational needs.

##Early Career Framework
The Department for Education has developed a 2 year package to support new teachers at the start of their career, based on the [Early Career Framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/supporting-early-career-teachers "external-inline").

The Early Career Framework was designed with an expert advisory group to support early career teacher development.

The support package includes:

  - funded 5% time off timetable in the second year of teaching, in addition to the existing 10% in the first year
  - a range of high-quality, freely available curricula and training materials underpinned by the Early Career Framework
  - funded training for mentors of early career teachers
  - funded time for mentors to support early career teachers

The support package will be launched:

  - to early rollout areas in September 2020
  - nationally from September 2021

This is part of government’s commitment to transform support for early career teachers.
