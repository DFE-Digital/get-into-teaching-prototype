##Teacher benefits

  - received a bursary or scholarship in the academic year 2020/21
  - taught in a state-funded school in England since finishing your teacher training course

You’ll get 3 additional early-career payments of £2k each in your second, third and fourth year of teaching. You may get £3k each year if you teach in certain areas. Find out more.

###Teachers’ Pension Scheme

The Teachers’ Pension Scheme gives you a regular source of income when you retire. It is:

  - based on your salary and service rather than investments so there will be no surprises about what you’ll get
  - registered with HM Revenue and Customs - so you don’t pay tax on contributions
  - flexible and allows you to take some of it as a tax-free lump sum
