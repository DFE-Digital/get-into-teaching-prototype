###Teachers’ Pension Scheme

The Teachers’ Pension Scheme gives you a regular source of income when you retire. It is:

  - based on your salary and service rather than investments so there will be no surprises about what you’ll get
  - registered with HM Revenue and Customs - so you don’t pay tax on contributions
  - flexible and allows you to take some of it as a tax-free lump sum
