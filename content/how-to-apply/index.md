##Choose a course
You can use the [Find postgraduate teacher training](https://www.gov.uk/find-postgraduate-teacher-training-courses "external-inline") service to search for courses in your area as well as further afield.

When you’re researching courses, you could also:

  - ask teachers
  - look at training provider websites
  - go to a teacher training event
  - read school [Ofsted inspection reports](http://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/ "external-inline")
  - compare university courses at [discoveruni.gov.uk](https://discoveruni.gov.uk/ "external-inline")
  - find out how many people finished their course and got a teaching job in the [initial teacher training census data](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/statistics-teacher-training#census-data "external-inline")
}

section{
##Write your personal statement
You must include a personal statement to apply for teacher training.

Your personal statement is the main part of your application, so write about the knowledge and skills you’ll bring to teaching. Make sure you get across your energy, enthusiasm and passion for teaching.

###What to put in your statement

Include information about:

  - why you want to teach
  - the skills and strengths you can bring to teaching like communication, organisation and creativity
  - why you’ll be a good teacher
  - the reason you want to teach your chosen subject and age group

Use relevant examples from:

  - your education and work experience
  - any school experience placements and what you have learned
  - any other experience you have of working with young people
}

section{
##Get two references
You must give two references to apply for teacher training.

Your referees need to comment on:

  - your skills
  - your personality
  - why you would make a good teacher

Your referees should not be family members, partners or friends.

Contact them before you apply and ask them to reply quickly when UCAS ask for their reference. A delay could mean that you may not get your first choice of training course.
