##Bursaries and scholarships
Bursaries and scholarships are tax-free amounts of money to help you while you train. You don’t need to pay them back.

They are only available in subjects where there is a shortage of teachers. You’ll need a first, 2:1, 2:2 degree or a PhD or Master's to be eligible.

##Get student finance
If a bursary or scholarship is not available for your course, you can borrow money to help pay for your fees and living costs. You can apply for a tuition fee and/or a maintenance loan even if you already have a student loan.
