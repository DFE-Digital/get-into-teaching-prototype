##Bursaries and scholarships
Bursaries and scholarships are tax-free amounts of money to help you while you train. You don’t need to pay them back.

They are only available in subjects where there is a shortage of teachers. You’ll need a first, 2:1, 2:2 degree or a PhD or Master's to be eligible.

You could get a bursary of up to £26,000 or apply for a scholarship of up to £28,000.

##Get student finance
If a bursary or scholarship is not available for your course, you can borrow money to help pay for your fees and living costs. You can apply for a tuition fee and/or a maintenance loan even if you already have a student loan.

You can apply for a tuition fee loan of up to £9,250 to cover the full cost of your course fees and a maintenance loan of up to £11,672 to help with your living costs.

##Applying for funding if you live outside England

Whether you’re a home student (living in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland), an EU student or a student from outside the EU, you may still be eligible for funding to train to teach.

If you live in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland you’ll need to contact your country’s student finance body.

If you’re an EU national starting a teacher training course in the academic year 2020/21, you could get a bursary or scholarship, and a tuition fee loan.

If you live outside the UK or EU/EEA, you can get advice about training to be a teacher by using the Teacher Training Adviser Service.
