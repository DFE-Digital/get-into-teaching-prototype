You may be able to get a teacher training grant. This is a tax-free amount of money to help you while you train. You don’t need to pay this back.

Grants for teaching are called bursaries and scholarships. They are only available in subjects where there is a shortage of teachers. You’ll need a first, 2:1, 2:2 degree or a PhD or Master's to be eligible.

####Get a bursary
You could get a bursary of up to £26,000. If the subject you want to teach is eligible for a bursary, you’ll get one when you start your course. You do not need to apply for a bursary.

####Apply for a scholarship
You can apply for a scholarship of up to £28,000. You’d get this instead of a bursary. There’s a lot of competition for scholarships. Whether you get one will depend on the subject you want to teach and the grades you’ve got.

###Check which subjects have bursaries and scholarships
These figures are for the academic year 2020/2021 If your subject is not listed, there is not a bursary or scholarship available. Primary teacher training bursaries are only available if you specialise in maths.

If you have an unrelated degree, but you studied the subject you want to teach at A level (or you have got professional experience in it) you could get a bursary for a subject knowledge enhancement course [link to SKE in How to become a teacher].
