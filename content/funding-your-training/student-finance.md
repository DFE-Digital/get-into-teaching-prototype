If a bursary or scholarship is not available for your course, you can borrow money to help pay for your fees and living costs. You can apply for a tuition fee and/or a maintenance loan even if you already have a student loan.

##Apply for a tuition fee loan

You can apply for a tuition fee loan of up to £9,250 to cover the full cost of your course fees. This means you will not need to:

pay course fees upfront
repay the loan until you’re working and earning money

##Apply for a maintenance loan

You can apply for a maintenance loan of up to £11,672 to help with your living costs. You’ll repay the loan when you’re working and earning money.

Use the student finance calculator to find out how much you can get.
