##Wales, Scotland or Northern island

If you live in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland you’ll need to contact your country’s student finance body. These finance bodies are:

  - Student Finance Wales
  - Student Awards Agency Scotland
  - Student Finance NI

##EU students

If you’re an EU national starting a teacher training course in the academic year 2020/21, you’ll be eligible for a bursary or scholarship, and a tuition fee loan. You need to have lived in the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland for three years before the start of the course.

##Students from outside the EU

Your tuition fees may be higher than fees for UK or EU/EEA students. Contact the university or training provider you want to train with to find out how much your fees will cost.

Get advice about training to be a teacher if you live outside the UK, EU/EAA by using Teacher Training Adviser Service.

There may be financial support available, but this will depend on your status as a home, EU/EEA or overseas student. Find out more from the UK Council for International Student Affairs.
