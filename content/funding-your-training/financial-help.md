You may be able to get financial help if you have a disability, or if you have children or dependent adults. If you get this type of funding, you do not need to pay it back.

##Disabled Students’ Allowances (DSA)

If you have additional needs like a mental health problem, long-term illness or disability you can apply for a DSA. The maximum amount is £20,000. Most students get less.

##Childcare Grant

You can apply for a Childcare Grant to pay for 85% of your childcare costs. The maximum you’ll get is:

£169.31 a week for 1 child
£290.27 a week for 2 or more children

##Parents’ Learning Allowance

If you have children, you may be able to get Parents’ Learning Allowance of between £50 and £1,716 a year.

##Adult Dependants’ Grant

If an adult depends on you financially, you can apply for an Adult Dependants’ Grant of up to £3,007.

Check the student finance calculator to find out what you can apply for.
