##If you don’t have a degree

You’ll need to apply for an initial teacher training (ITT) course that will give you qualified teacher status (QTS). Courses usually take 3 to 4 years and include:

  - Bachelor of Education degree (BEd)
  - Bachelor of Arts (BA) and Bachelor of Science (BSc) with QTS

Search [UCAS](https://digital.ucas.com/search "external-inline") to find a degree with QTS.

##If you have an overseas degree

If you studied overseas, you’ll need to find out if your qualifications are recognised in the UK. Contact us on 0800 389 2500 for advice.

We can also give you a free UK National Recognition Information Centre (UK NARIC) statement to show what your qualifications are equivalent to in the UK.

If you’re a graduate from outside the European Economic Area (EEA), you may need to apply for a visa before starting your teacher training course.

Contact the school or university you want to train with to find out.

##If your degree is not in the subject you want to teach

If you need to top up your knowledge of the subject you want to teach, you could take a subject knowledge enhancement course (SKE). An SKE may be right for you if:

  - your degree is not in the subject you want to teach, but is related
  - you studied the subject at A level, but not at degree level
  - you have an unrelated degree, but relevant professional experience in the subject
  - it’s been some time since you used your degree knowledge

You can do an SKE course in:
  - maths
  - physics
  - languages
  - chemistry
  - computer studies
  - biology
  - English
  - geography
  - design and technology
  - religious education
  - primary maths

Courses last between 8 and 28 weeks. SKE courses are funded, so you will not have to pay any tuition fees. You may also be eligible for a bursary of £5,600 for a 28-week course or £2,400 for a shorter course of 12 weeks.

If you think an SKE course will help you, contact the schools or universities you want to apply to for more information.

##Specialist ways to get into teaching

###School Direct salaried places

You’ll earn a salary while you train and you will not pay tuition fees. These places are usually given to graduates with at least 3 years’ work experience.

###Postgraduate teaching apprenticeship

Postgraduate teaching apprenticeships are similar to school direct salaried places. You’ll be employed by a school to learn on the job over 4 terms. You’ll then take an assessment. This is a salaried training place so you will not pay tuition fees.

###Teach First

You’ll need to have a 2:1 degree or higher to apply for a place. You’ll train over 2 years by learning on the job. You’ll be paid as an unqualified teacher and you will not pay tuition fees.

###Researchers in schools

You’ll need (or be about to finish) a doctorate in the subject you want to teach. You’ll then train over 3 years with a bursary. If you have a lot of relevant work experience you could train and earn a salary.

###Assessment only (AO)

If you’re a teaching assistant or unqualified teacher with two years’ experience you can be assessed over 12 weeks to get QTS. This way of getting QTS will not give you a PGCE. You’ll only need a PGCE if you want to do a master’s qualification or teach outside the UK.

###Postgraduate Early Years Initial Teacher Training (EYITT)

A number of postgraduate Early Years Initial Teacher Training (EYITT) courses are available at university or via a school-led route – all lead to Early Years Teacher Status (EYTS) on successful completion. EYTS is different to QTS in that you specialise in working with children up to five years old only.
