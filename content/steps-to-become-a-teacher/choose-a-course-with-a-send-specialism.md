You could choose teacher training with a SEND specialism. These courses focus on developing your skills for working with pupils with SEND.

Find courses with a SEND specialism by selecting ‘Show only courses with a SEND specialism’ on [Find postgraduate teacher training](https://www.gov.uk/find-postgraduate-teacher-training-courses "external-inline").

##Get experience

You don’t have to take a SEND specialist course. If you want to be a SEND teacher you can apply to teach in a special school if you have:

  - been teaching for a few years
  - experience of managing SEND pupils in your primary or secondary school

##Teaching children with sensory impairments

If you want to teach pupils with hearing, vision or multi-sensory impairments, you’ll need a specific qualification. Find out about [mandatory qualifications](# "external-inline") for specialist teachers.

##Be a Special Educational Needs Coordinator (SENCo)

As a SENCo you’ll be responsible for assessing, planning and monitoring the progress of children with SEND. To apply for a job as a SENCo, you'll need to:

  - be a qualified teacher
  - complete the National Award in Special Educational Needs Coordination (NASENCO) when you take up the SENCO post

[Find out about NASENCO](https://nasen.org.uk/training-and-cpd.html "external").

Special educational needs (SEN) allowance

If you’re a qualified teacher of pupils with SEND, you could get an allowance of between £2,209 and £4,359 per year.
