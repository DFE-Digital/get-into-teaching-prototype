  <p>Teaching will give you the chance to use your skills to inspire young people and make sure every pupil gets the same access to a quality education.  Itâ€™s a career that offers varied opportunities, where no day is ever the same.</p>
</div>

##Inspire the next generation
As a teacher you can help children develop their talents and expand your own skills too.

In addition to the day job you can get involved in after-school activities, clubs, trips or sport.

Real stories of how people became teachers

Find out about [Teachersâ€™ salaries](./teachers-salaries-and-benefits) and other financial benefits

##Career progression

Training to be a teacher will give you the opportunities to add to your professional skills and help you achieve your ambitions.

The Department for Education (DfE) has made it easier to find a teaching role in England, by using the [Teaching Vacancies service](https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/).

###Leadership

Leadership roles in a school can offer a number of different opportunities, from taking charge of a year group or a particular key stage; to becoming a deputy or headteacher.

As a leader, youâ€™ll have an influence in the school, setting high standards and ensuring continuous improvement throughout the school.

###Focus on your subject

If youâ€™re passionate about your subject area, you can pursue a career as a head of department or as a leading practitioner.  

In these roles youâ€™ll still teach, but have additional responsibilities.

###Pastoral care

If youâ€™re interested in the welfare of students throughout their education, a pastoral role might be for you. You could also take on the role of a mentor for young people with special educational needs.

##Early Career Framework

The Department for Education has developed a 2 year package to support new teachers at the start of their career, based on the Early Career Framework.

The Early Career Framework was designed with an expert advisory group to support early career teacher development.

The support package includes:

  - funded 5% time off timetable in the second year of teaching, in addition to the existing 10% in the first year
  - a range of high-quality, freely available curricula and training materials underpinned by the Early Career Framework
  - funded training for mentors of early career teachers
  - funded time for mentors to support early career teachers

The support package will be launched:

  - to early rollout areas in September 2020
  - nationally from September 2021

This is part of governmentâ€™s commitment to transform support for early career teachers.
