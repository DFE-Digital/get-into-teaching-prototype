  <h2 id="if-you-dont-have-a-degree">If you don’t have a degree</h2>

  <p>You’ll need to apply for an initial teacher training (ITT) course that will give you qualified teacher status (QTS). Courses usually take 3 to 4 years and include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Bachelor of Education degree (BEd)</li>
    <li>Bachelor of Arts (BA) and Bachelor of Science (BSc) with QTS</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Search <a href="https://digital.ucas.com/search" class="external-inline" target="_blank">UCAS</a> to find a degree with QTS.</p>

  <p>Sign up to get support from a teacher training adviser, who can help you with your personal statement, which funding you can get and how to complete your application.</p>

  <h2 id="if-you-have-an-overseas-degree">If you have an overseas degree</h2>

  <p>If you studied overseas, you’ll need to find out if your qualifications are recognised in the UK. Contact us on 0800 389 2500 for advice.</p>

  <p>We can also give you a free UK National Recognition Information Centre (UK NARIC) statement to show what your qualifications are equivalent to in the UK.</p>

  <p>If you’re a graduate from outside the European Economic Area (EEA), you may need to apply for a visa before starting your teacher training course.</p>

  <p>Contact the school or university you want to train with to find out.</p>

  <h2 id="if-your-degree-is-not-in-the-subject-you-want-to-teach">If your degree is not in the subject you want to teach</h2>

  <p>If you need to top up your knowledge of the subject you want to teach, you could take a subject knowledge enhancement course (SKE). An SKE may be right for you if:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>your degree is not in the subject you want to teach, but is related</li>
    <li>you studied the subject at A level, but not at degree level</li>
    <li>you have an unrelated degree, but relevant professional experience in the subject</li>
    <li>it’s been some time since you used your degree knowledge</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You can do an SKE course in:
  - maths
  - physics
  - languages
  - chemistry
  - computer studies
  - biology
  - English
  - geography
  - design and technology
  - religious education
  - primary maths</p>

  <p>Courses last between 8 and 28 weeks. SKE courses are funded, so you will not have to pay any tuition fees. You may also be eligible for a bursary of £5,600 for a 28-week course or £2,400 for a shorter course of 12 weeks.</p>

  <p>If you think an SKE course will help you, contact the schools or universities you want to apply to for more information.</p>

  <h3 id="school-direct-salaried-places">School Direct salaried places</h3>

  <p>You’ll earn a salary while you train and you will not pay tuition fees. These places are usually given to graduates with at least 3 years’ work experience.</p>

  <h3 id="postgraduate-teaching-apprenticeship">Postgraduate teaching apprenticeship</h3>

  <p>Postgraduate teaching apprenticeships are similar to school direct salaried places. You’ll be employed by a school to learn on the job over 4 terms. You’ll then take an assessment. This is a salaried training place so you will not pay tuition fees.</p>

  <h3 id="teach-first">Teach First</h3>

  <p>You’ll need to have a 2:1 degree or higher to apply for a place. You’ll train over 2 years by learning on the job. You’ll be paid as an unqualified teacher and you will not pay tuition fees.</p>

  <h3 id="researchers-in-schools">Researchers in schools</h3>

  <p>You’ll need (or be about to finish) a doctorate in the subject you want to teach. You’ll then train over 3 years with a bursary. If you have a lot of relevant work experience you could train and earn a salary.</p>

  <h3 id="assessment-only-ao">Assessment only (AO)</h3>

  <p>If you’re a teaching assistant or unqualified teacher with two years’ experience you can be assessed over 12 weeks to get QTS. This way of getting QTS will not give you a PGCE. You’ll only need a PGCE if you want to do a master’s qualification or teach outside the UK.</p>

  <h3 id="postgraduate-early-years-initial-teacher-training-eyitt">Postgraduate Early Years Initial Teacher Training (EYITT)</h3>

  <p>A number of postgraduate Early Years Initial Teacher Training (EYITT) courses are available at university or via a school-led route – all lead to Early Years Teacher Status (EYTS) on successful completion. EYTS is different to QTS in that you specialise in working with children up to five years old only.</p>
