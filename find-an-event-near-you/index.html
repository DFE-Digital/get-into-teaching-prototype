<p>Our nationwide events are informal opportunities for you to get free expert advice about your next steps into teaching.</p>

<h2 id="types-of-events">Types of events</h2>

<h3 id="train-to-teach">Train to Teach</h3>

<p>At our Train to Teach events, you can meet experienced teaching professionals who can answer all of your questions.</p>

<p>You’ll get the chance to:
* speak to experts about ways into teacher training and available funding
* talk one-to-one with experienced and newly qualified teachers to find out what teaching is really like
* get advice on your teacher training application
* meet schools and universities in your area to help you decide where to train and how to apply</p>

<p>You can drop in at any time. Allow at least two hours to make the most of your visit. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OuHTmB1j-ceovpLQw96UGhs_07ALWvlK/view">Train to Teach presentations</a> run hourly throughout the event.</p>

<p>Check event timetables to make sure you don’t miss anything.</p>

<h3 id="online">Online</h3>

<p>These interactive sessions let you talk with a panel of specialist advisers and get questions answered within minutes. See what matters to other potential trainee teachers too. Joining a conversation is easy – check in regularly to see what discussions we’ve got lined up.</p>

<h3 id="school-and-university-events">School and university events</h3>

<p>Schools and universities that run teacher training courses often hold their own events. Typically they cover areas such as:
* course information
* application advice
* school experience
* opportunities to talk to current trainees or staff</p>
