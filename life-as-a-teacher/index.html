      <h1>Life as a teacher</h1>
      

      <div class="jumbotron">
  <p>Teaching will give you the chance to use your skills to inspire young people and make sure every pupil gets the same access to a quality education.  It’s a career that offers varied opportunities, where no day is ever the same.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="inspire-the-next-generation">Inspire the next generation</h2>
<p>As a teacher you can help children develop their talents and expand your own skills too.</p>

<p>In addition to the day job you can get involved in after-school activities, clubs, trips or sport.</p>

<h2 id="career-progression">Career progression</h2>
<p>Training to be a teacher will give you the opportunities to add to your professional skills and help you achieve your ambitions.</p>

<p>The Department for Education (DfE) has made it easier to find a teaching role in England, by using the <a href="https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/" class="external-inline" target="_blank">Teaching Vacancies service</a>.</p>

<h3 id="leadership">Leadership</h3>
<p>Leadership roles in a school can offer a number of different opportunities, from taking charge of a year group or a particular key stage; to becoming a deputy or headteacher.</p>

<p>As a leader, you’ll have an influence in the school, setting high standards and ensuring continuous improvement throughout the school.</p>

<h3 id="focus-on-your-subject">Focus on your subject</h3>
<p>If you’re passionate about your subject area, you can pursue a career as a head of department or as a leading practitioner.</p>

<p>In these roles you’ll still teach, but have additional responsibilities.</p>

<h3 id="pastoral-care">Pastoral care</h3>
<p>If you’re interested in the welfare of students throughout their education, a pastoral role might be for you. You could also take on the role of a mentor for young people with special educational needs.</p>

<h2 id="early-career-framework">Early Career Framework</h2>
<p>The Department for Education has developed a 2 year package to support new teachers at the start of their career, based on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/supporting-early-career-teachers" class="external-inline" target="_blank">Early Career Framework</a>.</p>

<p>The Early Career Framework was designed with an expert advisory group to support early career teacher development.</p>

<p>The support package includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>funded 5% time off timetable in the second year of teaching, in addition to the existing 10% in the first year</li>
  <li>a range of high-quality, freely available curricula and training materials underpinned by the Early Career Framework</li>
  <li>funded training for mentors of early career teachers</li>
  <li>funded time for mentors to support early career teachers</li>
</ul>

<p>The support package will be launched:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to early rollout areas in September 2020</li>
  <li>nationally from September 2021</li>
</ul>

<p>This is part of government’s commitment to transform support for early career teachers.</p>
