      <h1>Funding your training</h1>

      <p>Teacher training tuition fees cost up to £9,250 depending on how you decide to train. You may be able to get a grant to help with the cost of your training. You’ll also be able to apply for student finance.</p>

<h2 id="find-out-about-teacher-training-grants" class="stand-out">Find out about teacher training grants</h2>
<p>You may be able to get a teacher training grant. This is a tax-free amount of money to help you while you train. You don’t need to pay this back.</p>

<p>Grants for teaching are called bursaries and scholarships. They are only available in subjects where there is a shortage of teachers. You’ll need a first, 2:1, 2:2 degree or a PhD or Master’s to be eligible.</p>

<h4 id="get-a-bursary">Get a bursary</h4>
<p>You could get a bursary of up to £26,000. If the subject you want to teach is eligible for a bursary, you’ll get one when you start your course. You do not need to apply for a bursary.</p>

<h4 id="apply-for-a-scholarship">Apply for a scholarship</h4>
<p>You can apply for a scholarship of up to £28,000. You’d get this instead of a bursary. There’s a lot of competition for scholarships. Whether you get one will depend on the subject you want to teach and the grades you’ve got.</p>

<h3 id="check-which-subjects-have-bursaries-and-scholarships">Check which subjects have bursaries and scholarships</h3>
<p>These figures are for the academic year 2020/2021 If your subject is not listed, there is not a bursary or scholarship available. Primary teacher training bursaries are only available if you specialise in maths.</p>

<p>If you have an unrelated degree, but you studied the subject you want to teach at A level (or you have got professional experience in it) you could get a bursary for a subject knowledge enhancement course [link to SKE in How to become a teacher].</p>
